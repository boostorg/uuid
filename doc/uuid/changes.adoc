== Changes in Boost 1.86.0 (**major update**)

* {cpp}03 is no longer supported, a {cpp}11 compiler is required.
  This includes GCC 4.8 or later, MSVC 14.0 or later, and MinGW-w64.
* Removed direct dependencies on Core, Io, Move, NumericConversion, StaticAssert,
  TTI, Random, ContainerHash. The library now only has five Boost dependencies
  (as opposed to 39 in Boost 1.85.)
* Moved `std::hash` support from `uuid_hash.hpp` to `uuid.hpp`.
* Moved serialization support from `uuid_serialize.hpp` to `uuid.hpp`.
* Added convenience header `<boost/uuid.hpp>`.
* Improved quality and speed of `hash_value`.
* Removed platform-specific entropy providers; the implementation now
  uses `std::random_device` as the source of entropy.
* Since `basic_name_generator` had only two valid instantiations, both of
  which are already provided (`name_generator_md5` and `name_generator_sha1`),
  it was made a private implementation detail and is no longer part of the
  public interface.
* While `name_generator` and `name_generator_latest` are still provided for
  compatibility, their use is no longer encouraged.
* The definitions of the well-known RFC 4122 namespaces have been moved to
  their own header, `boost/uuid/namespaces.hpp`.
* Added `operator\<\=>`.
* The generic (non-SIMD) implementations of `is_nil`, `operator==`,
  `operator<`, `swap`, and `operator\<\=>` now use `__uint128_t` operations
  when that type is available, and `uint64_t` operations otherwise.
* `basic_random_generator` has been moved to its own header,
  `boost/uuid/basic_random_generator.hpp`.
* `basic_random_generator` has been changed to hold the underlying generator
  by value, to avoid dynamic allocation and restore copyability.
* `random_generator_pure` is now an alias for
  `basic_random_generator<std::random_device>` and its use is discouraged.
* `random_generator_md19937` is now an alias for
  `basic_random_generator<std::mt19937>` and its use is discouraged.
* `random_generator` now uses a cryptographically strong pseudorandom number
  generator (ChaCha20), seeded with entropy from `std::random_device`. It's
  the recommended way to generate version 4 UUIDs.
* Added `time_generator_v1`, a generator that produces version 1 time-based
  UUIDs.
* Added `uuid_clock`, a `<chrono>`-compatible clock with an epoch and a
  resolution as specified in RFC 4122.
* Accessors for the timestamp, the time point, the clock sequence, and the
  node identifier have been added to `uuid`.
* Improved the `what()` strings of the `std::runtime_error` exceptions
  thrown by `string_generator`.
